Map Gardening
=========

A collection of scripts by [Alan McConchie](https://github.com/almccon) for the analysis of "map gardening" in OpenStreetMap

What is map gardening? For now, let me explain by offering the abstract from my presentation at the 2013 Association of American Geographers conference:

> While the volume of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) continues its rapid growth, many collaborative mapping projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) are entering a mature phase, where the primary activity shifts away from the initial creation of data to its ongoing maintenance. As OSM approaches "completeness" in some geographic areas, there remain the less glamourous--but no less important--tasks of adding attribute data and periodically updating the map to reflect changes on the ground.

> Most research to date does not differentiate between various types of interaction with VGI datasets, thereby leaving many questions unanswered. For example: are the users who initially contribute data the same users who maintain it later? Do the types of tasks undertaken by users change over the duration of their engagement with a project? Are initial contributors more or less likely to have local knowledge of a place than those who maintain that data later?

> In this presentation we propose a typology of modes of interaction with VGI datasets, specifically distinguishing between the acts of adding new data and editing existing data. We adapt the term "wiki gardening" from research on Wikipedia, and propose the term "map gardening" to describe volunteer-led maintenance of VGI data. We apply this concept to the OpenStreetMap dataset, presenting a quantitative analysis of the extent and frequency of map gardening, and making comparisons across different spatial and temporal scales and between individual users. We argue that this typology offers a new insight for understanding the evolution and social dynamics of crowdsourced geospatial datasets.

This github repository includes some of the scripts I am using to perform this quantitative analysis. At this point they may not be complete or functional, but in time I hope to post all my code here.
